# Recursion

In this repository, you will practice using recursion.

## Objectives

- Use recursive calls to solve challenges.

## Basic Requirements

Complete all of the questions in the `challenges.js` file.

### 1. Open the file in your browser

- [ ] Open the `index.html` file.
  - Note where this file connects to the JavaScript file.
  - Open the file in your browser.
  - Open the JavaScript console to see the results of your code.

### 2. Answer all of the challenges.

- [ ] Answer each question in the challenges file.
- [ ] When you are done answering, comment it out!
  - To comment out a line, use `//` in front of the line, or encapsulate the entire line with `*/ code /*`.

### 3. Try to re-do the challenges you solved by applying tail call optimization

- [] Read about tail call optimization:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call
  - https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html

### Commit early, commit often!

- [ ] After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
  - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
  - `git add .` adds all files
  - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
  - `git push` pushes changes
